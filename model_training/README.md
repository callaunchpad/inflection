# Training

For training, there is a lot of freedom. Essentially, there is a `predict` function which takes the input MFCCs as a parameter and outputs the output MFCCs. You can pretrain any type of model to complete this function. The skeleton code and how to use it can be found in the `trainer` notebook.

If you would like to see an example and sample results, you can check out the [Research] section.
