# Webapp

The web app uses the trained model, a frontend with Chrome speech-to-text, and an Amazon Lex backend to create a fully functional voice-converted voice assistant. The front-end is stored in index.js and the flask backend can be put up by running:


```

```

Make sure you follow the instructions from the training notebook to import the model, otherwise it will not work.
